# Musings-BE
A Blog that is connected to the Terminal so uploads can be done liked Git Push requests

The Blog is setup so that blog posts are not put into fixed categories put have hashtags placed on them. Which will be used for
when people are looking to search for different related content (myself mainly) 

Reduces time spent upon initial organisation and allows for quick read time as well.

To execute the commands they must be called in the CLI with "program" then their respective commands. Which are listed below
